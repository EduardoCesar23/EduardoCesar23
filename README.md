- 👋 Hi, I’m Eduardo Cesar
- 👀 I’m interested in finishing school
- 🌱 I’m currently learning... I don't know what I'm learning
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a charity to help poor people in acquiring basic human needs like Fortnite
- 📫 You can reach me trough the sewer and out of my sink
- 😄 Pronouns: He's inside your walls
- ⚡ Fun fact: 20% of car accidents are caused by drunk drivers, therefore the majority of car crashes are caused by sober drivers, proving that, in fact, driving drunk is safer overall (this is merely a joke).
